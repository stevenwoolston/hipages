# hi-pages Scraper ðŸ¤–

This project is an automated scraper designed to monitor the **hi-pages** website for new leads. It uses **Puppeteer** to navigate and scrape content based on customizable keywords. When a potential lead is found, it saves the details and sends an **email notification**. The project also includes a **React-based UI** for viewing the scraped leads.
